## Welcome to Jinkel Delivery!

You're a poor delivery "creature" and recently started working at "Hurkel's Pizzas" though the boss is kinda stingy, you still need the money! The goal of the game is to deliver as many pizzas as possible. If you don't deliver the pizza in time, the customer will be mad and won't pay you any money. If you don't deliver the pizza before your shift ends, a small fee will be subtracted from your wage. Get a positive wage to continue to the next level! The levels will increase in difficulty, so be ready!

### Controls:

    You can move around with "A" and "D" 
    Get on and off your scooter with "S"
    Throw pizzas with "W" 
    Get pizzas at the pizzeria with "Space Bar" Though you need to be off your scooter to be able to get one.

## Personal note:

All the assets and programming is done by me, except for the sounds of the customers. Those were made by a very good friend of mine :) The world is procedurally generated, so every level will be slightly different. This project was made for an university project.

## Future Updates:

I'm still interested in working on this game. I think about adding a buy system in game to be able to use your wage to buy something like a pizza bag to carry more pizzas to make harder levels less difficult. 

I will also be doing bug fixes if you guys find any (I'm sure there are still a lot of them)
